### Why do we use functions in JavaScript?

- Functions are essentially a block of code, that are given a name and can be run as many times as we want.
- By using functions, we reduce the redundancy in the code by minimizing the re-qwrite of similar codes.

### What is Function Invocation?

- The code inside a function is not executed when the function is defined.
- The code inside a function is executed when the function is invoked.
- It is common to use the term "call a function" instead of "invoke a function".
- It is also common to say "call upon a function", "start a function", or "execute a function".

### What are Events in Javascript?

- JavaScript's interaction with HTML is handled through events that occur when the user or the browser manipulates a page.
- When the page loads, it is called an event. When the user clicks a button, that click too is an event.

### What is a string?

- A string is a sequence of one or more characters that may consist of letters, numbers, or symbols. 
- Strings in JavaScript are primitive data types and immutable, which means they are unchanging.

### What is an array? Is it static or dynamic in Javascript?

- An array is a collection of similar data elements stored at contiguous memory locations.
- An array is dynamic in javascipt cause it allows addition of elements in it even after its declaration.

### Difference between Map and Set?

- A Map is collection of keyed data items, just like an object. But the manin difference is that Map allows keys of any type.
- A Set is a collections of elements (without any keys), where each value may occur only once.

### Difference between Array and Map?

- An array is a collections of items that are of same type. They form a linear list, and store elements at continous subsequent memory space.
- A Map is a collection of keyed data items and work just like an object. They allow keys of different types.

### What are array methods? List a few names?
- In Javascript, we get many function to perform different tasks in an array. THe methods are as follows:
 1. push(...items)
 2. pop()
 3. splice()

### In how many ways can we traverse through an array in Javascript?

- Javascript provides several methods to allow traversal in an array through javascript. They are:
 1. Using for/while loop
 2. Using the every() function // It allows to perform some text on every element of an array
 3. Using map
 4. Using reduce

### Program to reverse an array
`let arr = [1,2,3,4]`  
`arr = arr.reverse();`  
`console.log(arr);`
