            Web development is the process of creating websites and web
            applications. It is a broad term involving various technologies,
            including web design, web content management, web scripting, web
            server, and web browser. We can also refer to the web development
            process as the development of a website.This document contains a
            list of the most common web development technologies and tools.

          <p>
            Web development is filled with thousands of concepts, frameworks,
            services and paradigms.Web development is the work involved in
            developing a website for the Internet. Web development can range
            from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex
            web applications, electronic businesses, and social network
            services.
          </p>
          <p>There are two subparts of the web development:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Frontend</li>
            <li>Backend</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
          <h1 id="header3">Frontend</h1>
          <p>
            The part of a website that the user interacts with directly is
            termed the front end. It is also referred to as the ‘client side’ of
            the application. It includes everything that users experience
            directly: text colors and styles, images, graphs and tables,
            buttons, colors, and navigation menu. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are
            the languages used for Front End development. The structure, design,
            behavior, and content of everything seen on browser screens when
            websites, web applications, or mobile apps are opened up, is
            implemented by front End developers. Responsiveness and performance
            are two main objectives of the Front End. The developer must ensure
            that the site is responsive i.e. it appears correctly on devices of
            all sizes no part of the website should behave abnormally
            irrespective of the size of the screen.

          <p>
            Backend is the server-side of the website. It stores and arranges
            data, and also makes sure everything on the client-side of the
            website works fine. It is the part of the website that you cannot
            see and interact with. It is the portion of software that does not
            come in direct contact with the users. The parts and characteristics
            developed by backend designers are indirectly accessed by users
            through a front-end application. Activities, like writing APIs,
            creating libraries, and working with system components without user
            interfaces or even systems of scientific programming, are also
            included in the backend.
